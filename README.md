# Multi-signature wallet

This project is a showcase of a multi signature wallet implementation. 

It offers the basic functionality for many individuals to have shared control over a single wallet.

## Next steps

Right now it lacks interesting features as adding new owners or removing existing ones.

We could do that in a similar way to how we approve transactions, we would have a list of
proposed owner additions or removals, and the current owners would vote for it.
 
## Commands

```shell
npm test
